Virtual serial communication using esp-idf.   

Long ago, most PCs had D-SUB serial ports.   
When PCs had D-SUB serial ports, serial communication between two PCs was very easy.   
Communication was possible with only one RS232C cross cable.   
```
+------------+                                              +------------+
| PC1        |              RS232C Cross-Cable              | PC2        |
|            |<-------------------------------------------->|            |
|            |                                              |            |
+------------+                                              +------------+
```

Before I knew it, the D-SUB serial port had disappeared from my PC, and it had changed a USB port.   
Using the USB port, serial communication between two PCs looks like this.   
```
+------------+     +------------+        +------------+     +------------+
| PC1        | USB | USB-UART   |  UART  | USB-UART   | USB | PC2        |
|            |     | Adapter    |        | Adapter    |     |            |
|            |     |            |        |            |     |            |
|            |<--->|        RX  |<-------| TX         |<--->|            |
|            |     |        TX  |------->| RX         |     |            |
+------------+     +------------+        +------------+     +------------+ 
```

ESP32S2/S3 has TinyUSB Serial Device function.   
It can communicate with the host via USB.   
By using this, serial communication can be made wireless.   
```
+------------+     +------------+        +------------+     +------------+
| PC1        | USB | ESP32S2/S3 |  WiFi  | ESP32S2/S3 | USB | PC2        |
|            |     |            |        |            |     |            |
|            |<--->|            |<------>|            |<--->|            |
|            |     |            |        |            |     |            |
+------------+     +------------+        +------------+     +------------+ 
```

ESP-NOW eliminates the need for a router.   
```
+------------+     +------------+        +------------+     +------------+
| PC1        | USB | ESP32S2/S3 | ESPNOW | ESP32S2/S3 | USB | PC2        |
|            |     |            |        |            |     |            |
|            |<--->|            |<------>|            |<--->|            |
|            |     |            |        |            |     |            |
+------------+     +------------+        +------------+     +------------+ 
```

___Since this application performs unicast communication, there is no limit to the order in which ESP32 is started.___   

# Limitation
The number of characters that can be read at once with tinyusb_cdcacm_read() is limited to 64 bytes.   
Changing CONFIG_TINYUSB_CDC_RX_BUFSIZE does not work around this limitation.   
If anyone knows a workaround, please let me know.   
```
I (30304) tinyusb_cdc_rx_callback: CONFIG_TINYUSB_CDC_RX_BUFSIZE=256 rx_size=64

Data exceeding 64 bytes is divided and sent to the other party.

# Software requirements
ESP-IDF V4.4/V5.0.   
ESP-IDF V5 is required when using ESP32-C2.   

# Hardware requirements
1. ESP32-S2/S3 Development board   
Because the ESP32-S2/S3 does support USB OTG.   

2. USB Connector   
I used this:   
![usb-connector](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/6020549/124848149-3714ba00-dfd7-11eb-8344-8b120790c5c5.JPG)

# Installation

```Shell
git clone https://github.com/nopnop2002/esp-idf-virtual-serial-port
cd esp-idf-virtual-serial-port
idf.py set-target {esp32s2/esp32s3}
idf.py menuconfig
idf.py flash
```


# Configuration
![config-top](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/6020549/223055571-090c3f71-5c81-431f-ab56-da831d41f6bd.jpg)


### Configuration for UDP Unicast
The two ESPs must use the same port.   
In order to perform UDP unicast communication, the IP address of the other party is required.   
This app uses mDNS to look up peer IP addresses with the same port number.   

![config-udp](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/6020549/223055578-6942f911-0a10-473c-b35d-c4115c5fe233.jpg)




When providing two or more sets of communication circuits, it is necessary to change the port numbers.

```

### Configuration for ESPNOW Unicast
The two ESPs must use the same channel.   
In order to perform ESPNOW unicast communication, the MAC address of the other party is required.   
This app uses PING communication to look up peer MAC addresses with the same channel number.   

![config-espnow](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/6020549/223055585-5e8b91dc-e356-41ba-8d5a-6a35d8c25972.jpg)



When providing two or more sets of communication circuits, it is necessary to change the channel numbers.   
The range of the channel of paired devices is from 1 to 14.

# Official example   
ESPNOW's official example is [here](https://github.com/espressif/esp-idf/tree/master/examples/wifi/espnow), but there are some bugs.   
The most egregious bug is the inability to communicate using channels other than 0 and 1.
